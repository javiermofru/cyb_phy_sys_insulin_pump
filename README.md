## Project Overview
In this project, our team has developed a simulation of an insulin pump's operation to thoroughly examine the vulnerabilities within this cyber-physical system.
The primary focus is on identifying and addressing vulnerabilities through the implementation of corresponding defenses to enhance the system's security.


## Selected Vulnerabilities
Our study targeted the following vulnerabilities: Unauthorized Access, Denial of Service, Eavesdropping, and Data Integrity.

## Simulation and Code Implementation
The code comprehensively simulates each vulnerability and its corresponding defense mechanisms. To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.x and Flask are installed. If not, install Flask using:
```python
python3 -m pip install Flask
```

2. Run the app.py file within the project folder using:
```python
python3 app.py
```

3. Open a browser window and enter the address: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## User Interface
The browser will display a user interface providing real-time visualization of the insulin pump's simulation. Additionally, an interactive display allows users to activate or deactivate specific vulnerabilities and defenses.

## Monitoring and Logs
Results of vulnerability activation and deactivation are printed in the terminal where the application is running. The logs provide detailed insights into the current status of the simulation and its communications.

This project serves as a practical exploration of cybersecurity measures within cyber-physical systems, demonstrating our team's commitment to understanding and addressing potential vulnerabilities in critical medical devices like insulin pumps.
